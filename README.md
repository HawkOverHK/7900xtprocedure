- Windows 11 re-install w/ RUFUS Before GPU Drivers(Basic Microsoft Drivers auto install) - Result: System Crash
- Windows 11 re-install w/ Microsoft Install Assistant version Before GPU Drivers(Basic Microsoft Drivers auto install) - Result: System Crash, System Hang, Black Screen(Grey + Blue lines for OLED)
- Swapped PSUs Corsair HX1000i, Corsair RM850x (2018 model), MSI A850GF *Note all 3 PSUs listed are compatible cable wise and are known to me as working units and interchangeable cables - Result: System Crash, System Hang, System Shut Off
- SSD Swap: Original SSD - WD SN750 500GB, Test SSD #1 - Samsung 970 EVO Plus 1TB, Test SSD #2 - Solidigm P41 Plus 1TB - Results: System Hang, Black Screens, System Shut Off
- Platform Swaps: Original Test System: GIGABYTE B650E AORUS MASTER + Ryzen 9 9950X + G SKILL TRIDENT Z5 32GB 6k MT / CL30, Test System 2: ASUS Z97-A + i7-4790 + 16GB DDR3, Test System 3: ASUS H110M-C + i5-7600 + 8GB DDR4 - Results for ALL 3: System Crash, System Reboot, System Shut Off, System Hang, Black Screen(Before and After Driver Installs)
- Note: All systems were put through Display Driver Uninstaller before and after swaps + SSD securely wiped before retesting
- Note 2: It may seem that utilizing VSR(Virtual Super Resolution) with more more than 1x display set for 4K might be a problem as well. I seemed to have been able to replicate this on my main system(Original Test System).
